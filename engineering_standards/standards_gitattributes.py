"""`gitattributes-eol`: every file a Unix shell reads must check out LF on every PC.

WHY. A CR is not cosmetic to `sh` or `bash`: it is read as part of the token, so a CRLF
script is a syntax error, not a slow one. Whether a checkout gets CRLF is decided by
`core.autocrlf`, which Git for Windows defaults to `true`, which differs per PC, and which
no clone carries. Only `.gitattributes` travels with the repository, and it outranks that
setting -- so it is the one place the answer can be made the same everywhere.

It has failed both ways it can. On 2026-08-27 a CRLF `_python.sh` reached every repo that
pulled the pack, died printing nothing, and so disabled the push gate silently (the pack's
own root `.gitattributes` records it). On 2026-10-06 a fresh clone of ellengaard-dk, on a PC
with `autocrlf=true` and no `.gitattributes`, checked every script out CRLF, and bash died
on `set -o pipefail\\r` inside a Linux container the scripts were bind-mounted into.

WHAT IS CHECKED: every versioned `*.sh`, every file under the pack's `hooks/` directory
(git hooks have no extension for `*.sh` to catch), and every `Dockerfile`, `Dockerfile.*`
and `*.Dockerfile` -- a `RUN` continuation ending in `\\` then CR breaks the same way. Each
must resolve `eol=lf`. `/apply-standards` seeds `templates/.gitattributes` into a repo that
has none; a repo that already had one keeps it, and this rule is what says which lines it
still needs -- the seed alone would be a one-off copy nothing re-checks.

GIT RESOLVES THE ATTRIBUTES, never a pattern matcher here: see `eol_attributes`. A tree
that is not in a repository at all has no checkout to convert, so it is quiet; a repository
git cannot be asked about is a limit on the scanner's reach, and is said so on stderr.

NO EXEMPTION, deliberately, and nothing registered in standards_exemption_scope.py: a
CRLF shell script is never correct, and the fix is one line in `.gitattributes`. Not
baselineable either, for the same reason as the gitignore family -- the write-baseline
pass does not collect it.

REPO-LEVEL, so it runs on a whole-tree scan only, for the gitignore reason.
