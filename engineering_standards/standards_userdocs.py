"""The shipped user-docs system: an in-product documentation registry, held as a contract.

User documentation for a web product ships AS product -- localised, styled, reachable at
the point of need -- not as markdown in a repo its users can never see. The pack cannot
ship that system, so it enforces the invariants of whichever one the repo built. The repo
declares where the machinery lives (`.standards.json`, key `userDocs`; see UserDocsConfig
in standards_core.py), and these rules hold it together:

    userdocs-missing        userDocs is declared but the registry file is absent or empty
    userdocs-dangling-slug  a help link names a topic the registry does not have
    userdocs-unlinked-page  a declared user-facing page carries no link into the docs
    userdocs-orphan-topic   a registry topic documents a route no page declares any more

The reference shape is InvoTrack's: DocRegistry.cs enumerates every topic (slug, route,
LastReviewed, content component), each tenant-facing page carries a PageHeader HelpSlug
into it, and Dokumentation.razor renders topics from the registry alone. The rules are
deliberately shape-agnostic -- a Django app can point them at a fixtures file and a
template include; only the patterns change.

REPO-LEVEL, LIKE standards_docs. Whether a topic is orphaned is a property of every route
in the tree, so `check_userdocs` runs on whole-tree scans only -- push and CI, never the
commit stage -- and findings ride the baseline ratchet like every other repo-level rule.

THE DOC-SYNC NUDGE IS A NOTE, NOT A VIOLATION. `unsynced_change_notes` runs at the commit
stage and prints when staged changes touch a documented page without touching the registry
or any topic content. It cannot block: whether an edit changed BEHAVIOUR (doc update owed)
or merely refactored (no doc owed) is exactly the judgment the pack leaves to /code-review,
and a blocking rule would fight every mechanical sweep across documented pages. The note
surfaces the question at the moment the answer is cheapest.

GLOB SEMANTICS ARE fnmatch: shell-style against the repo-relative posix path, `*` crosses
directory separators. Declared inventories should therefore anchor on real path prefixes
(`App/Components/Pages/Manage/*.razor`), which doubles as the repo's own statement of
which pages are user-facing -- the admin-only and auth surfaces simply stay out of the
globs instead of collecting exemption markers.
