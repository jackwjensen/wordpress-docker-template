"""The dispatcher: which rules run against which file.

Split out of standards_checks.py on 2026-08-25. That module's own docstring described it as
"what each LANGUAGE looks like, plus the dispatcher", which is two jobs -- the language rules
say what a violation looks like, this says what gets asked. They change for different reasons:
adding a rule for an existing language touches only the first, and putting a NEW KIND OF FILE
in scope (`.nvmrc`, for the Node floor) touches only this one.

WHY THIS FILE IS WHERE THE BUGS LIVE. A rule that is correct but never reached is
indistinguishable from a rule that passes, and this pack has shipped that failure before --
workflows once hit an early return that ran only the deploy-gate rule. Every early `return`
below is therefore load-bearing, and the dispatcher tests go through THIS function rather than
calling a rule directly, precisely so an unreachable rule fails a test instead of going quiet.

    # where it could not. Its own verification hid the gap: "run over all ten repos: zero
    # findings" reads identically whether a rule is clean or blind. A real double-encoded
    # em-dash then sat in wappit.net's docker-compose.production.yml through a green gate
    # until it was spotted by eye on 2026-08-10 -- the exact "caught by eye, which is not a
    # control" failure this rule was written to end.
