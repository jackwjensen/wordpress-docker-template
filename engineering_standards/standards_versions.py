"""The toolchain versions this estate develops on, and the rule that enforces the safe half.

Rules here: action-version, ci-toolchain, runtime-support.
Floors declared here but enforced elsewhere: NODE_FLOOR (standards_node_support.py),
PYTHON_FLOOR (standards_python_support.py), PHP_FLOOR (standards_php_support.py).

THE LIST LIVES IN THIS FILE, not in a versions.toml beside it. Every adopted repo already
receives `engineering_standards/*.py`, so putting the numbers here makes them present wherever the scanner
runs, with no second file to sync and no chance of the data and its enforcement disagreeing.
A TOML file would read more nicely and would be the pack's own "restated in two layers" rule
broken in the one place it is least affordable.

FOUR TIERS, FOUR DIFFERENT AUTHORITIES. Collapsing them into one list is the mistake this
module exists to avoid, because a single "upgrade everything" list turns a routine
/apply-standards run into an unattended production runtime change:

  ACTION_FLOORS   CI plumbing. No runtime risk at all -- the action's own Node runtime is
                  invisible to the application. /apply-standards rewrites these outright and
                  `check_action_versions` below fails a repo that falls behind.

  CI_DEFAULTS     What CI installs to run the checks. Applied only where the repo declares
                  nothing itself; a repo with a .nvmrc or global.json wins, because CI's
                  toolchain must satisfy the app rather than dictate to it.

  RUNTIME_BASELINE  What production actually runs. REPORTED, NEVER REWRITTEN. Changing it
                  means a rebuild, a redeploy and a real chance of breakage, so it is a
                  watched per-repo decision. No rule enforces it, deliberately.

  DOTNET_FLOOR    The oldest .NET major the estate will ship. ENFORCED, NEVER REWRITTEN
  NODE_FLOOR      -- the fourth tier, added 2026-08-18, and the distinction from the tier
                  above it is the whole reason it can exist without contradicting it.
                  NODE_FLOOR joined it on 2026-08-25 for a reason worth keeping: Node 24
                  had already been declared the estate minimum and set in CI_DEFAULTS, and
                  four pins in two repos stayed on 22 with nothing reporting them. Tier 2
                  defers to a repo's own pin, so it can never move a repo that has one.
                  Only a floor fails a repo, and failing is what makes /apply-standards
                  the moment a repo catches up.

THE FOURTH TIER, AND WHY IT IS NOT THE THIRD ONE IN DISGUISE. RUNTIME_BASELINE is a
preference: "what we run today". Enforcing a preference is what the tier-3 note refuses,
because /apply-standards would then rewrite a production runtime unattended. DOTNET_FLOOR
is not a preference -- it is a support *fact* with a date attached, and shipping past that
date means shipping something Microsoft has stopped patching. So the floor is enforced the
way ACTION_FLOORS is enforced: the scanner FAILS a repo that falls behind and tells a human
to act. It never edits a project file, and /apply-standards never touches a TFM. "Fail and
name it" and "rewrite it for you" are different powers, and only the second one was ever
the thing tier 3 declined.

#
# THE NUMBER IS A SUPPORT DATE, NOT A TASTE. Dates below are Microsoft's published
# end-of-support, read from the official policy page on 2026-08-18 (which the page itself
# stamped "last updated 2026-08-11"), not from a blog post or from memory:
#
#     .NET  8 (LTS)  released 2023-11-14  ends 2026-11-10   -- maintenance
#     .NET  9 (STS)  released 2024-11-12  ends 2026-11-10   -- maintenance
#     .NET 10 (LTS)  released 2025-11-11  ends 2028-11-14   -- the only one in ACTIVE support
#
# 8 and 9 expire on the SAME DAY, which is what makes 10 the only defensible floor: there is
# no "one more release of headroom" option to fall back to. STS support was extended from 18
# to 24 months, which is why .NET 9 outlived the May-2026 date some older notes still carry.
#
# THIS IS NOT "BE ON THE NEWEST". A floor of 10 is enforceable precisely because 11 is not
# out yet, so nobody has to chase anything; when .NET 11 (STS) ships in November 2026 the
# floor STAYS at 10, because 10 is the LTS and an STS is not an upgrade the estate owes
# anyone. Raise this to 12 in late 2028, not to 11 in late 2026.

# ---- tier 4: the oldest Node major the estate will run --------------------------------------
#
# 24 is the minimum accepted anywhere, decided 2026-08-25. It is the active LTS; 22 has moved to
# maintenance and 20 is done.
#
# WHY THIS IS A FLOOR AND NOT JUST A NUMBER IN CI_DEFAULTS. It was tried as a number first, and
# the number is the tier that CANNOT deliver "everywhere": CI_DEFAULTS only fills a gap, so it
# reaches a repo that declares nothing and is outranked by every repo that pins its own version
# -- which is every repo that has any Node at all. That is precisely how the previous attempt at
# moving the estate to 24 left three pins behind and nothing said a word. A floor is the tier
# that fails a repo, so applying or updating the pack in a repo is the moment it has to move.
#
# WHAT IT READS, and why these three. A Node version gets declared in exactly three places in
# this estate, and a floor that missed any one of them would be enforcing the toolchain
# everywhere except where it is actually set:
#
#   .nvmrc                    the repo's own pin, which outranks everything else
#   node-version: in CI       what the workflow installs
#   FROM node:N in a Dockerfile   what the image is built on
#
# package.json `engines.node` is deliberately NOT read. It is conventionally a RANGE (">=20",
# "^22 || ^24"), and a floor that tried to judge a range would either mis-read a permissive one
# as a violation or accept a range whose lower bound is years old. No repo here sets it; when
# one does, it wants its own rule with range semantics rather than a wrong answer from this one.
# The rule, its readers and its regexes moved to standards_node_support.py on 2026-08-25 --
# this module was at 470 of the pack's own 500 lines, and the parsing had to become a reusable
# reader before `node-consistency` could see it. The NUMBER stays here, beside DOTNET_FLOOR and
# PYTHON_FLOOR, because this file is the one place a human looks when lifting a floor.
NODE_FLOOR = 24
# ---- tier 4: the oldest Python the estate will run ------------------------------------------
#
# 3.14, decided by Jack on 2026-08-25, and the reasoning is the reason it is 3.14 and not 3.12:
# "code gets outdated really fast, so if we use packs that are already out of maintenance then
# we build legacy from day one."
#
# PYTHON HAS TWO SUPPORT BOUNDARIES, NOT ONE, and that is the whole argument. Every release
# gets ~2 years of BUGFIX support and then ~3 years of security-only patches (PEP 602). A floor
# set at "still gets security patches" would accept 3.10, which stopped getting bugfixes in
# April 2023. A floor set at "still gets bugfixes" is 3.14. Verified against
# https://devguide.python.org/versions/ on 2026-08-25, not from memory -- the same discipline
# DOTNET_END_OF_SUPPORT documents. The per-version dates are in standards_python_support.py,
# beside the rule that quotes them, exactly as EF_PROVIDER_SUNSET sits beside its own rule.
#
# THIS IS STILL A MINIMUM, NOT "BE ON THE NEWEST". 3.14 stays in bugfix support until
# 2027-10-01, so it does NOT need re-deciding when 3.15 ships on 2026-10-01 -- a repo that
# starts on 3.15 passes, because being ahead of a floor is never a finding. Raise this to 3.15
# in late 2027, when 3.14 leaves bugfix support, not the day 3.15 appears.
#
# A TUPLE, NOT A FLOAT AND NOT A STRING. `3.9 > 3.14` is true for floats and true for strings;
# it is false for `(3, 9) > (3, 14)`, which is the only one of the three that is right. Every
# version this rule reads is normalised to a (major, minor) tuple for that reason alone.
PYTHON_FLOOR = (3, 14)

# ---- tier 4: the oldest PHP the estate will run ---------------------------------------------
#
# 8.5, decided 2026-08-25 on the same reasoning as PYTHON_FLOOR. PHP's "active support" is the
# bugfix phase: two years of real fixes, then two more of security-only patches. Dates read from
# php.net/supported-versions.php that day, and carried in PHP_ACTIVE_END beside the rule.
#
#     8.3  active support ENDED 2025-12-31   -- what all four PHP repos declare today
#     8.4  active support ends  2026-12-31   -- four months of runway
#     8.5  active support ends  2027-12-31
#
# 8.4 satisfies the letter of "still maintained" and would force a second estate-wide migration
# before Christmas, which is the opposite of lifting a floor deliberately. 8.5 is the current
# stable with over a year ahead of it. The rule is in standards_php_support.py.
