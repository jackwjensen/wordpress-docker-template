"""Reading a gate's non-zero exit: was the tool absent, or did the check really fail?

Split out of `standards_gates.py` on 2026-09-05, when that module crossed the pack's own
500-line limit while gaining the `declared` guard below. The two halves are different
concerns anyway: `standards_gates` decides WHAT runs and WHEN; this module decides what a
non-zero exit MEANS, and which lines of it are worth showing.

THE DIRECTION IS THE WHOLE POINT and it runs one way only. A skip is invisible in the exit
code, so every phrase matched here is a shell's, a driver's or a container runtime's own
wording for an absent tool -- never anything a linter, a compiler or a failing test can emit.
Widening one of them to catch a genuine failure would report a red suite as skipped, which is
the exact shape of bug this pack exists to prevent. Each pattern below carries the case that
taught it.

# The driver's wording varies by SDK version -- "program" and "file" have both shipped (the
# "file" variant surfaced 2026-08-15 on a CI runner without dotnet-ef, where the miss made
