"""--write-baseline must not grandfather files that are exempt from the length limit.

Written after a real incident (DonorLink, 2026-08-15): a --write-baseline run recorded the
seven `Data/Translations/*.cs` files -- all carrying a valid `standards: file-length exempt`
marker since 2026-08-10 -- into `.standards-baseline.json`, and the write had to be reverted
by hand. Baselining an exempt file converts a written decision into frozen debt: the next
line added to it (a new translation key, a new lookup row) fails the build, which is exactly
the outcome the exemption exists to prevent.

The suite drives the real CLI via subprocess rather than importing the hyphenated module,
because the writer's behaviour IS the contract here: the commit hook, CI, and a human at a
terminal all reach it through exactly this entry point.
