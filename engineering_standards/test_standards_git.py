"""Cases for the git seam: what the scanner asks git, and what it does when git cannot say.

Written on 2026-09-01 after `tests-uncovered-module` was tightened. This module had passed
the loose version on a bare-name match, which is the false negative that tightening removed.

The distinction this module exists to keep is **"cannot tell" versus "nothing"**, and it is
the one a test protects best, because collapsing the two is invisible and changes what the
whole scanner examines. `staged_files` returns None when git cannot be asked and [] when the
commit is genuinely empty; `ignored_files` deliberately returns an empty set on failure, so a
repository it cannot read scans MORE rather than less. Those two answers point in opposite
directions on purpose, and either one silently flipping would be a live defect: the first
would scan nothing at commit time, the second would stop reporting a developer's `.env`.

Every case builds a real repository, because the subject IS git's behaviour -- a mocked
`git` would test the mock, which is the anti-pattern `testing.md` names.
