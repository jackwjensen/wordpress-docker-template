"""The rule that makes baselined debt actually move.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The ratchet stops debt getting WORSE: a baselined 900-line file fails at
901. It says nothing about the file staying at 900 forever, and that is exactly what
happens -- `refactoring.md` has said "a baseline is a starting point, not a resting place"
since 2026-08-21, and the strongest thing it could say after that was "when you touch a
repo with baselined debt, pay some of it down. Do not ask whether you are allowed to; you
are." That grants permission. It requires nothing.

Permission is not enough, and the reason is structural rather than moral: an optional
refactor loses every race against a deadline, so it is always the thing that gets dropped,
and a rule that costs nothing to skip is not a rule. This module is that policy with a
gate behind it.

THE RULE. If your branch changes a baselined file, that file leaves the branch smaller
than it arrived, and the baseline records the new size.

TWO CONDITIONS, because either alone leaks:

  1. Current size is below what the baseline recorded AT THE BASE REF -- proof this branch
     paid something down.
  2. The baseline in the working tree records the NEW size -- proof it was regenerated.
     Without this the recorded number never moves, so the next branch to touch the file
     clears condition 1 for free and the ratchet quietly stops ratcheting.

Comparing against the base ref rather than the working tree is what keeps the two from
deadlocking: regenerating the baseline (which condition 2 demands) would otherwise
immediately make the branch look like it had paid nothing.

WHEN IT RUNS. Push and CI, never commit. Being blocked on your first commit into a big
file would only teach people --no-verify, and the unit of work this judges is the branch.

WHAT IT DOES NOT TOUCH. A file carrying a valid file-length exemption is exempt here too.
An exemption means "looked at; nothing to fix", so demanding it shrink anyway would be the
pack arguing with a decision it already accepted -- and would push people to delete the
marker, which is the one thing that makes the decision visible.
