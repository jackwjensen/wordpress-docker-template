"""What each registry publishes for a declared dependency: its stable releases, and when.

THE PACK'S FIRST NETWORK CODE, so its boundaries are deliberate:

* Every request goes through one `Fetch` callable. Production passes `http_fetch`; every test
  passes a dictionary of canned responses, so no test ever touches the network.
* Only https, only GET, a short timeout, and only the registries named below. An unknown
  registry answers "unsupported" -- a named, printed state -- rather than a guess.
* A failure is an ANSWER, not an exception: `Answer.error` says what went wrong, and the caller
  decides what an unreachable registry means (warn on a developer machine, fail in CI).

RELEASES, NOT JUST "NEWEST". Decision 14 of the 2026-10-02 plan judges a dependency by its LINE
-- a newer patch in the pinned line blocks, a newer major is a notice until the pinned line's
support runs short -- so the gate needs every stable release, and for a package with no
published lifecycle, WHEN the pinned line last shipped. Where a registry's version list carries
no dates (NuGet's flat container) or no commits (GitHub releases are tags), the newest release
of each major is enriched with one extra request rather than every release.

"STABLE" MEANS NO PRERELEASE: a preview SDK, an `-rc` package or an `11.0.0-preview.1` tag is
never proposed. Docker tags are compared only within the pin's own SHAPE -- the same number of
numeric parts and the same suffix -- and an image's `lts` tag, where it publishes one, names the
preferred release (MySQL's `innovation` 26.7.0 is not 8.4's successor; `lts` 9.7.2 is).

A GitHub token is used when the environment provides one (`GITHUB_TOKEN`, as Actions sets it,
or `GH_TOKEN`); unauthenticated requests are limited to 60 an hour per IP.
