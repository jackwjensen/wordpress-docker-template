"""Cases for the exemption report: what a run tells you has been silenced.

Written on 2026-09-01 because `tests-uncovered-module` reported this module on its first
run over the pack -- it was split out of `check-source-limits.py` days earlier and never
got a suite. That is the rule doing its job on its own author, which is the best evidence
it is calibrated.

The subject matters more than its size. This module is what makes an exemption VISIBLE:
every file-scoped marker is a rule switched off for a whole file, and the argument for
allowing that at all is that each one gets printed on every run where a reviewer sees it.
If this module quietly stops listing a marker, `clean` goes back to meaning "clean, except
where somebody wrote a sentence you cannot see" -- silently, and in the direction nobody
checks.

Run: pytest test_standards_exemption_report.py
