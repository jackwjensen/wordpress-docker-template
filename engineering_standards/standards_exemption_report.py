"""Naming every relaxation the scanner is honouring.

An exemption nobody sees is just a baseline with better manners. The whole argument for
putting the marker IN the file, rather than in a ledger beside it, is that somebody
reviewing the repo can read the reason and disagree with it -- and that requires the
reason to appear somewhere they actually look. `clean` has to be a claim anybody can
check, which it is not while a sentence in a file header can switch a rule off in silence.

WHY THIS IS ITS OWN MODULE. It was a function in check-source-limits.py, whose docstring
calls that file the driver -- walking the tree, ratcheting the baseline, reporting, CLI.
Reporting relaxations grew into a concern with its own rules (which markers are
load-bearing, which scopes the walk can see, which files the summary cannot reach), and
adding it pushed the driver over the 500-line limit. The pack's own instruction for that
moment is explicit: give the new concern its own module, never trim a comment to fit.

    IT ASKS THE FILE WHAT IT DECLARES rather than asking about rules it was told to
    expect, and that inversion is the fix for a real hole. This used to name three rules --
    `file-length`, `query-shape`, `claude-md-length` -- because those were the three
    somebody had wired up. Every other file-scoped marker silenced its rule and appeared in
    no output at all: `client-address`, `cors`, `tls`, `sql-injection`, the two concurrency
    rules, `paged-without-order` and the rest -- rules that could be switched off for a
    whole file without the summary, the gate, or CI ever mentioning it. `clean` then meant
    "clean, except where somebody wrote a sentence you cannot see".

    "Load-bearing" is still applied to the two rules that can cheaply answer it: a
    `file-length` marker on a file since split under the limit, or a `query-shape` marker
    on a query since rewritten, is stale rather than a decision, and printing it would
    train people to skim past the list. No such re-check exists for the other rules -- it
    would mean running every rule twice -- so their markers are reported as declared.

    "SINCE THE SCANNER REALLY IS HONOURING THEM" is what that last clause used to say, and
    it was false for every tag outside `FILE_SCOPED_TAGS`. Asking the file what it declares
    means the answer includes tags no rule reads at file scope -- a misspelling, a rule whose
    hatch is line-scoped, a rule that deliberately has none -- and each was printed here as an
    honoured decision. The registry now filters them out and `exemption-inert` reports them,
    so this list is once again only what it says it is.

    KNOWN GAP: `.md` is out of per-file scope, so a docs page's `docs-orphan-page` or
    `docs-plan-page` marker is still named nowhere; CLAUDE.md is handled below because it
    is the one that matters most. Those rules have no line-scoped form, so nothing is
    silently widened by them -- but they are invisible, which is the lesser half of the
    same defect. Closing it means giving this a markdown pass, not another list of rules.

    LINE-SCOPED markers are also absent, and for a harder reason: they are resolved inside
    each rule's own walk, against a line number only that rule knows. Their blast radius is
    one line, where a file marker's is the file.
