"""Cases for the committed-credential rule.

EVERY CREDENTIAL FIXTURE IS ASSEMBLED AT RUNTIME, never written as a literal. A detector whose
own test suite trips it is one that gets exempted on sight -- and the pack has already been
bitten once by exactly this, when a `.py` file holding `node-version: '22'` as a fixture was
read as a real declaration and failed the pack's own gate. Concatenation keeps the literal out
of the source text while the assembled string is byte-identical at the moment it is judged,
which is the only moment that matters.

The negatives carry unusual weight here. `.env.example` full of key names, a fixture password,
an interpolation like `${DB_PASSWORD}` and an empty value are all things secrets.md explicitly
ALLOWS to be committed, and a rule that flags them makes the file it enforces unreadable.

Run: python test_standards_secrets.py   (or pytest)
