"""The testing dimension: code that nothing exercises, and tests that cannot fail.

    tests-uncovered-module   a source module no test names
    test-without-assertion   a test function that asserts nothing
    test-always-passes       an assertion whose operands are all constant
    test-silently-skipped    a test disabled with no stated reason

standards: test-without-assertion exempt -- the strings in this module are the patterns it
detects, quoted so the detector can be written against them; nothing here is a test.

WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. `documentation.md` has opened with "Code, tests, documentation. The
first two are gated" since it was written, and tests were not gated by anything -- no rule,
no rules file, nothing. The pack asserted a gate it did not have, which is the worst of both:
the claim discourages anybody from noticing, and nothing enforces it.

WHY IT DOES NOT GRANDFATHER, which is the design decision worth defending. The first draft
of this rule was a change-ratchet -- a branch that touches source must touch a test -- chosen
because it produces no findings on day one. Jack rejected that on 2026-09-01, and the reason
generalises past this rule: designing a requirement so that it never disturbs existing code
is how a requirement becomes decorative. Every escape built into the rule is an escape
somebody takes. So this fires on every uncovered module today, and adoption relief lives
where it belongs -- in the baseline, a separate, visible, opt-in decision that repos which
want a ramp can take and Jack's repos do not.

The exclusions below are therefore not relief. Each is a shape with genuinely nothing to
run: a declarative table defines no behaviour, a vendored file is somebody else's code, a
migration is verified against a real schema rather than by a unit test, and a test is not
its own subject. If an exclusion ever reads as "we would rather not disturb this", it is
wrong and should be deleted.

WHAT "COVERED" MEANS, and its honest limit. The test corpus must name the module -- by its
stem, or by a symbol it defines. That is the `docs-uncovered-command` bargain: naming is a
weak proxy for exercising, and it is the strongest thing a scanner can decide without
running the suite. It catches the case that actually bites -- a module nothing has ever
looked at -- and it cannot tell a thorough suite from a shallow one. The quality rules below
cover the other end (a test that cannot fail); everything between them is `/code-review`'s.

THE FILENAME CLAIM IS SCOPED TO ITS PACKAGE (2026-09-03). A stem is a weak name and many
stems repeat: `admin`, `models`, `views`, `tasks`, `schema` and `serializers` exist in every
app of a Django project. Matching them repo-wide meant the first app to grow a
`test_admin.py` marked `admin.py` covered EVERYWHERE -- measured in allegro-it-services,
where it silenced a 488-line module that no test named and no test exercised. A filename
claim now reaches only the package the test sits in (`_filename_claim_scope`); a repo whose
tests all live in one root tree is unaffected, because its scope is the repo root. Symbol
matching stays repo-wide: a symbol name is distinctive enough to be evidence wherever it
appears, and scoping it would break the normal way a monorepo tests a shared package.
