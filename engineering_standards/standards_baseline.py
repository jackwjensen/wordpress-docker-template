"""The debt ledger: reading it, writing it, and who may authorise a write.

Rules here: none. This is the ratchet the driver operates, plus the policy gating it.

WHY IT IS ITS OWN MODULE. `check-source-limits.py` named four jobs in its own docstring --
walking the tree, RATCHETING THE BASELINE, reporting, CLI. The second was always a separable
subject; adding consent gave it a fifth collaborator (a human at a terminal) and pushed the
file past its own 500-line limit, which is how the seam became visible rather than how it was
chosen. Reading, writing and authorising the ledger are one subject and live here; walking,
reporting and the CLI stay in the driver. (Never split for the number -- see
claude/rules/refactoring.md.)

THE POLICY, stated by Jack 2026-08-27, when a review agent proposed baselining a repo's
existing dependencies so that only new ones would need justifying:

    "you tend to use it to avoid following the rules, and thereby invalidating those rules
    and making them ineffective"

A baseline written without consent is indistinguishable from the rule not existing. The ratchet
is for DEBT -- work somebody looked at and deliberately deferred -- and the failure mode is an
agent under time pressure reaching for it to turn a red build green. `NEVER_BASELINED` already
refuses the findings for which deferral is not even coherent; this refuses the *unattended act*
for all the rest.

    pack ever named. So "reset the baseline" reads as one action and does half the job.

    Measured in allegro-it-services on 2026-09-03: deleting `.standards-baseline.json`
    surfaced 205 findings and felt like a full reset. The ESLint file was still holding 96
    suppressed violations across 66 files -- 66 `max-lines-per-function` and 30 `complexity` --
    including a 594-line component whose 220-line function read as clean while a 79-line one

    the reason this count now appears on the same line as the others.
