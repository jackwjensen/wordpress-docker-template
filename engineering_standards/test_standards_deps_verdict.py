"""Cases for standards_deps_verdict: every state the gate can reach, and which of them block.

Decision 14 of the 2026-10-02 plan is asserted at its edges: a later major is a notice with more
than a year of the pinned line's support left and blocks with a year or less; a package with no
published lifecycle is judged by whether its line still ships.

Run: python test_standards_deps_verdict.py   (or pytest)
