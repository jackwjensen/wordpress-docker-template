"""The gate's two genuinely dangerous decisions: what runs when, and what counts as a skip.

Replaces the escape-hatch regex tests. That hatch was a regex over the command STRING,
because a `PreToolUse` hook inspects a command that has not run yet; the gate is a git hook
now, so `SKIP_STANDARDS_GATE=1 git commit` sets a real environment variable and the whole
pattern -- along with its "is this a use of the hatch or a commit message about it?"
ambiguity -- is gone. `verify.py` reads `os.environ` and that is the entire implementation.

What replaces it is the pair of judgements that can now fail silently:

* Stage assignment. If an expensive gate leaks into the commit stage, commits get slow and
  slow gates get bypassed. If a gate vanishes from BOTH stages, nothing ever runs it.
* Skip classification. A skip is invisible in the exit code, so a pattern that matches too
  eagerly turns a real failure into a pass -- the exact shape of bug this pack exists to
  prevent. Those cases live in `test_standards_gate_outcomes.py`, beside the classifier.
