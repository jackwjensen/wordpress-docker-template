"""Migrations. The one command, whatever the stack underneath.

    python engineering_standards/migrate.py                 # what stack, what is pending  (read-only)
    python engineering_standards/migrate.py new AddInvoiceVat
    python engineering_standards/migrate.py apply           # against the LOCAL dev database

WHY THIS EXISTS. Migrations were the last workflow in the pack documented only as prose:
`claude/rules/migrations.md` explained the discipline and then named a different command
per stack, in a repo whose central rule is that a standard restated in two layers will
drift. `verify.py` had already closed that hole for build/test/lint; this closes it for the
one workflow whose first real execution is against production.

The value is not the typing it saves -- it is that "how do I add a migration here?" has a
findable answer that does not depend on knowing whether this repo is EF Core or Django, and
cannot disagree with a README that was written when it was the other one.

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. It never touches a remote database, and it has no flag
that would let it. Production migrations in this estate run from the deploy, on the server,
and a local tool that could reach production is a local tool that eventually will -- see
PUBLISH_NOTES.md for the 2026-05-28 incident where an unattended migration took a site down.
`apply` refuses outright when the environment names a production target.

Exit codes: 0 = done, 1 = the underlying command failed, 2 = bad invocation.
