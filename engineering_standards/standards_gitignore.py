"""`gitignore-missing`: the build output and secrets a repository must never version.

Split out of standards_layout.py on 2026-09-03, when adopting `ruff format` expanded that
file past the pack's own 500-line limit. The seam was already drawn -- the file carried a
`# ---- gitignore ----` divider and two rules that share nothing: `generic-filename` reads
ONE path and asks whether its name identifies anything, while this reads the WHOLE tree and
asks what it contains. Different subject, different scope, different reason to change.

REPO-LEVEL, so it runs on a whole-tree scan only -- never at commit. Blocking every commit
in a repo whose .gitignore is short would block the commit that fixes it, which is the same
failure the staged scope exists to prevent.
