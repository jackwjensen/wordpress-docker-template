"""Which rules are about the REPOSITORY rather than about one file.

Split out of check-source-limits.py on 2026-09-07, when wiring `const-duplicated-literal` --
the thirteenth repo-level rule -- put that file at 505 of its own 500 lines. The pack's CLAUDE.md
names the answer for exactly this case: give the new concern its own module rather than trim a
comment back under the limit. `standards_gates.py` was split the same way and for the same
reason while the gate feature was being written.

THE SEAM IS THE REASON TO CHANGE. This module changes when a repo-level rule is ADDED; the
driver changes when walking, baselining, reporting or the CLI does. They had been one file
purely because the assembly had nowhere else to live, and the assembly is the half that grows:
it has gained a rule roughly every fortnight since the docs family landed, and each one cost
the driver an import at the top and a call in the middle.

A REPO-LEVEL RULE IS ONE OF TWO KINDS, and the comments below keep saying which because the
distinction decides what a new rule needs. Some READ THE REPOSITORY'S SHAPE -- gitignore,
sensitive files by name, a committed schema dump -- and take only the root, because the thing
they look at is not in any file the per-file walk reaches. The others COMPARE FILES -- the
toolchain-consistency family, and now the duplicated-constant rule -- and take `paths`, so they
examine exactly the set the per-file rules did rather than a second, differently-scoped tree.
