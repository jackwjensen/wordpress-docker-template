"""Every declared dependency is pinned to exactly one release.

Rule here: dependency-unpinned.

THE POLICY (Jack, 2026-10-02): pin everything, and make every new release be looked at. The
second half is the dependency gate (`deps.py check`, at push, needing the network); this is the
first half, at COMMIT and offline, so an unpinned declaration is refused the moment it is
staged rather than discovered at push.

ONE DEFINITION OF "PINNED", shared with the gate: the readers and `is_exact` in
standards_deps_declared. The gate and this rule ask the same question of the same parse, so they
cannot disagree about what a pin is -- a second regex here would be a second answer.

ESTATE-WIDE, NOT ONLY WHERE THE GATE IS ADOPTED. Jack, 2026-10-02: "blocking is the pack doing
its job." A repo with floating versions goes red at its next sync, and the fix is to pin them.

NEVER BASELINED, like package-wildcard: a floating version is not reproducible today, and a
baseline entry would only record that. Line-exemptable for the declaration that genuinely cannot
name one release (a vendor that publishes only a floating tag), with the reason beside it.

PACK-OWNED COPIES ARE THE PACK'S. A root file carrying the pack's source-of-truth footer is
judged in the pack, which pins it; the scanner's scope already keeps `engineering_standards/`
out of a consumer's run.
