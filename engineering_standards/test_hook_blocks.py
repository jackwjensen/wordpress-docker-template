"""A gate is verified by making it fail: a violating commit must be REFUSED.

This automates the sandbox procedure the pack CLAUDE.md has always prescribed as prose
("prove the hook still blocks -- in a throwaway repo"). Every silent-allow bug the pack has
had -- the BOM in the old hook payload, the dispatcher's swallowed `;` -- passed a "does a
clean commit work?" test perfectly, which is why the probe here asserts the refusal first
and the clean pass second.

Run: python test_hook_blocks.py   (or pytest; needs git on PATH)
