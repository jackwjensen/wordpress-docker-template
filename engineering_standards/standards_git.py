"""Which files a commit is actually about, read from the git index.

Split out rather than inlined into the driver for the same reason the other modules are
split: this changes when the question "what is being committed?" changes, which is a
different subject from what a violation is or which files are in scope.

WHY SCOPED SCANNING EXISTS. Checking the whole repository on every commit sounds strictly
safer and is not. A repo that starts red cannot be committed to at all, so a large body of
work is forced to sit uncommitted -- and uncommitted work is one mistake away from gone.
That is not hypothetical: roughly 620 lint fixes in allegro-it-services lived only in the
working tree for a day, because the gate required whole-repo green, and a `git checkout --`
over `git diff --name-only` destroyed every one of them. Nothing was staged, so nothing was
recoverable. A gate that checks what you are committing lets the clean half land today.

Whole-repo verification still happens -- at push, and in CI. See standards_gates.py.

WHAT THIS READS, AND THE ONE CAVEAT. `staged_files` names the paths in the index; the
scanner then reads those files from the WORKING TREE, not from the index. The two agree
whenever whole files were staged, which is how this estate works in practice. They diverge
under hunk-level staging (`git add -p`), where the working tree holds edits the commit does
not. Rather than let that pass silently -- a gate reporting on bytes that are not being
committed is exactly the "looks like it passed" failure this pack exists to prevent --
`partially_staged_files` names the affected paths so the caller can say so out loud.

Materialising the index to a temp tree would remove the caveat and was rejected: the
`env-example-compose` rule asks whether `docker-compose.yml` exists at the repo root, and a
tree containing only the staged files would answer that wrongly. Trading a loud, rare,
named caveat for a silent, systematic misfire is the wrong direction.

It is also the scanner's one door to git for the two tree questions only git can answer
exactly -- which files the repository ships (`versioned_files`), and what its
`.gitattributes` resolve for them (`eol_attributes`, asked by `gitattributes-eol`).

    WHY THE SCANNER NEEDS THIS. A whole-tree run walks the filesystem, and the filesystem
    holds files no commit will ever contain -- a developer's `.env` being the one that
    matters. `committed-credential` matches `.env` by NAME and reports it as "being
    committed", which is true of a staged one and false of an ignored one; without this,
    the rule read presence in the working tree as presence in git. The two are the same
    thing only on a CI runner, whose fresh checkout has no `.env` -- so the false positive
    fired on every developer machine and never once in CI, which is why it survived.

    `--others --ignored --exclude-standard` is the exact question, and the exactness is
    the point: `--others` means UNTRACKED, so a `.env` somebody has staged or committed is
    not in this set and stays flagged. The rule keeps the case it exists for and loses only
    the case it was never about.

    here it means an unreadable repository scans every file it can see, so a scanner that
    cannot ask git falls back to reporting too much rather than too little. For a rule about
    credentials, the noisy direction is the safe one.
