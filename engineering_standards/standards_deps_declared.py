"""Every dependency a repository declares, and the version it is pinned at.

Read-only: no rule lives here. The dependency gate (`deps.py check`) asks this module what the
repository depends on, asks `standards_deps_registry` what is newest, and judges the pair with
`standards_deps_verdict`. Splitting the reading out keeps each module answerable to one
question, and lets every reader be tested without a network.

WHAT COUNTS AS DECLARED: a version written in a file the repository owns -- project files,
lockless manifests, Dockerfiles, compose files, workflows, `global.json`. Lockfiles are NOT read:
they record what was resolved, and the decision this gate polices is the one a person wrote.

HOW MANY NUMBERS NAME ONE RELEASE is a fact about the vendor, not about the tag. Most number a
release with three parts, so `redis:7.2-alpine` and `node:24` are LINES -- tags that move onto
every patch -- and stay unpinned. PostgreSQL has numbered releases MAJOR.MINOR since 10
(`16.1`, `17.6`: the major is the line, the minor is the patch), so `postgres:16.1-alpine` is one
release and no three-part postgres tag exists to pin instead. `TWO_PART_RELEASES` names those
vendors' official images, and `release_parts` is the one answer both `is_exact` and the registry
lookup's tag shape read (found 2026-10-14, when allegro-it-services could only pin postgres by
digest). It is a pack-held list rather than either alternative, deliberately:

* not REGISTRY EVIDENCE ("no `16.1.N` tag is published, so `16.1` is a release"): pinning is
  decided offline, at commit, by `dependency-unpinned` from this same `is_exact` -- a network
  answer would make the commit rule and the push gate disagree -- and Docker Hub's tag list is
  paged, so an absent deeper tag is not proof; that failure would pass a floating tag.
* not a `.standards.json` DECLARATION: the numbering is the same in every repository, so a
  per-repo key is a copy waiting to drift, and one repo declaring `redis` two-part would reopen
  exactly the floating tag this rule refuses, with no reason attached.

An image missing from the list fails closed -- its two-part pin reads as unpinned -- and the fix
is one line here, never a looser pattern. Until then a digest pin is still a pin.

PACK-OWNED FILES ARE SKIPPED IN A CONSUMER. `engineering_standards/requirements.txt` and the
analyzer list in `Directory.Build.props` belong to the pack: a consumer cannot change them
(the next sync overwrites the edit), so judging them there would block a push on a decision the
repo is not allowed to make. The pack judges them in its own checkout, and the sync carries the
result out. A root-level pack copy is recognised by the footer every pack file carries.
