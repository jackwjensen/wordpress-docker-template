"""What a repo is allowed to tune, and the defaults when it tunes nothing.

Split out of standards_core.py on 2026-08-25, when adding the `python-consistency` flag put
that module at 503 of its own 500 lines. The seam is the subject that grew: this file changes
when a rule gains a knob or a threshold moves, while the rest of core changes when the shared
name/money/date vocabulary does -- two different reasons, two different readers.

The alternative was to shave a comment back under the limit, which is what the pack's own
CLAUDE.md names as the wrong answer every time it has come up. The limit exists to get
oversized files split, not to get their explanations deleted.

IMPORT DIRECTION: standards_core imports FROM here and re-exports, never the reverse. Nothing
in this module may import standards_core, or the re-export becomes a cycle. That is also why
the DEFAULT_ constants moved with the dataclasses rather than staying behind -- they are the
defaults these fields take, and splitting a value from its only consumer is how the two drift.

# Calibrated against 209 real query chains across InvoTrack, DonorLink, allegro-it-services,

DEFAULT_QUERY_MAX_LINES = 30

# The ceiling for one `claude/rules/*.md` file. The same number as a source file, on purpose:
# the threshold is answering the same question in both places -- has this file taken on a

# benefit. The judgment half is claude/rules/documentation.md; the check is standards_rules.py.
DEFAULT_RULES_MAX_LINES = 500

# The ceiling for the always-loaded judgment layer as a WHOLE, in lines.
#
# THIS IS THE ONE NUMBER THAT MAPS TO THE ACTUAL COST. Per-file length cannot see ten small
# always-load files, and ten small files dilute a session exactly as much as one large one.
#
# Calibrated 2026-08-27 against the pack's own set. It had been 1,661 lines across nine files
# -- roughly 24,000 tokens in every session in every adopted repo, a number nobody had ever
# chosen. Four reductions brought it to 1,218: scoping migrations.md and ui-standards.md with
# `paths:`, promoting `paged-without-order` into the scanner, moving the Laravel section into
# the (scoped) PHP rules, and paying down prose that a docs page or a module docstring could
# hold.
#
# THE NUMBER IS DELIBERATELY NOT ROUND. It is where the work actually landed plus enough for
# one honest edit, and no more. Rounding up would hand back most of the headroom the reduction
# just bought, which is how a ratchet becomes a rubber stamp; setting it at exactly the
# measured total would fail the next one-line clarification and teach people to raise the
# number reflexively. The next rule that wants always-load space has to pay for it by scoping,
# promoting or trimming something -- which is the entire mechanism.
#
# Second pass, 2026-09-10: 1,225 to 600, prompted by the first pass's own headroom running
# out -- the set had grown back to exactly 1,225, one clarification from failing in the repo
# that carries no baseline. Four moves, and the ratchet is why they were available at all:
#   - SPLIT documentation.md (214) into an always-loaded constitution (74) and the
#     `paths:`-scoped docs-authoring.md (170). Most of that file was the contract for writing
#     a page, which a session that never opens docs/ was paying for anyway.
#   - MOVED the .NET-only prose out of two language-neutral files into the path-scoped C#
#     rules: the `var`-removal hazard from naming.md, the IQueryable projection trap and the
#     BodyWriter detail from data-access.md.
#   - DELETED the Laravel lazy-loading bullet from data-access.md. php-standards.md had held
#     the full version since the first pass; docs/judgment-layer.md recorded it as MOVED, and
#     it had been copied -- the always-loaded layer was carrying the duplicate.
#   - SCOPED refactoring.md, data-access.md and naming.md (Jack, 2026-09-10), the three files
#     the pass had argued were unscopeable. They are language-neutral, and that turned out to
#     be the wrong question: what decides it is whether a GATE can send a reader here. All
#     three sit on rules a scanner detects, so the finding is the trigger and the file does
#     not have to be carried in advance. That criterion is now in docs/judgment-layer.md, and
#     it is why this number more than halved rather than shaving a few lines.

    -- `{"maxFileLines": 100000}` or `{"checkGitignore": false}` -- silently disabled any
    rule, required no argument, and appeared in no output, so a repo that had turned off the
    gitignore check printed the same `clean` as one that passed it honestly. That is the
    back door behind every front door this pack bolts.

    Measured before this existed: a 2000-line file and a float money field both vanished
    from the report under `{"maxFileLines": 100000, "checkMoneyTypes": false}`, and nothing
