"""Which rules apply to a file that is NOT source code, keyed on its filename.

Split out of standards_dispatch.py on 2026-09-02, when `check_source_file` reached
cyclomatic complexity 37 against the pack's own limit of 10 -- 36 branches and 104
statements in one function, which the pack was shipping as a rule to nine repositories
while breaking it here. The seam is the one the function already had: a compose file, a
Dockerfile, a workflow and a `.csproj` are each in scope for a short, fixed list of rules
and nothing else, while source files go through the language dispatch that stayed behind.

A TABLE, NOT AN if/elif CHAIN. The chain was the complexity: adding a file type meant
editing a function nobody could hold in their head, and the ordering constraints inside it
were invisible. Written out as `DISPATCH` below, each entry is one file type, its rules are
one small function, and the two places where ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING are stated where they
apply rather than being a property of where a branch happened to sit.

FIRST MATCH WINS, and every handler is terminal -- exactly as the early `return`s were.
