"""Finding the PROJECTS in a repository, and what tooling each one declares.

Split out of standards_gates.py on 2026-08-27, when wiring the pay-down gate put that file
at 508 of its own 500 lines. The seam is the question each half answers: this module asks
"what is in this repository and what does it say it uses", while standards_gates asks "what
therefore runs, and when". They change for different reasons -- a new project layout moves
this file, a new stage or gate moves that one.

Re-exported by standards_gates, because migrate.py and test_standards_gate.py both reach
for these names there and moving a function is not a reason to break their imports.
