"""The standards checks themselves: what counts as a violation in each language.

One tool, five files, each changing for its own reason:

    standards_core.py       what a violation IS, which files are in scope, file length
    standards_checks.py     what each LANGUAGE looks like
    standards_dispatch.py   which rules run against which file (split out 2026-08-25)
    standards_razor.py      razor-var: the one rule reading markup and C# at once
    standards_sentinels.py  zero-like sentinels: unset-not-zero and payload-default
    check-source-limits.py  the driver: walking, the baseline ratchet, reporting, CLI

The core names are re-exported below so `from standards_checks import CheckConfig` keeps
working for the driver.

Rules here: mojibake (via standards_encoding), bool-prefix, money-not-decimal, date-sentinel,
date-out-of-range, php-strict-types. razor-var lives in standards_razor.py and unset-not-zero and payload-default live in
standards_sentinels.py; all three are re-exported for the dispatcher.

# public/protected/internal bool Foo { get; set; }  -- captures the member name.
# A member declaration starts either at the beginning of the line or straight after a `{`,
# `}` or `;` -- which is what makes a single-line class body reachable:
#
#     public class P { public bool Active { get; set; } public bool Done { get; set; } }
#
# MEMBER_START must be a LOOKBEHIND, not a consumed character class. The boundary before the
# second declaration is the `}` (or `;`) that ENDS the first one, and finditer resumes at the
# end of the previous match -- so a consuming `[{};]` has already eaten the only boundary the
# next match could have used, and every declaration after the first stays invisible. That is
# the same bug in a new place, so it is spelled out here rather than left to be rediscovered.
#
# `^` is zero-width and the lookbehind is fixed-width, so alternating them is legal; a single
# lookbehind mixing the two widths would not be.

# and no declared name after the type.
VALUE_START = r"(?:^|(?<=[{};(,]))\s*"

# Every modifier that can precede a member declaration, matched one word at a time rather
# than as hand-written combinations. The old spelling enumerated pairs (`private protected`,
# `protected internal`) and, in the bool rule, silently omitted plain `private` -- so a
# private boolean was exempt from a rule its own money sibling applied to. Matching word by

# public property -- the reader of a class body reads both. A mechanical rule that applied to
# only half the declarations read as arbitrary, and the same name was legal as a field and
# illegal once promoted to a property.
#
# What the two rules do NOT share is whether a qualifier is required at all, and that
# difference is load-bearing:
#
# * bool requires AT LEAST ONE qualifier, which is what keeps method-body locals out. A regex
#   cannot tell `private bool active;` from a local `bool active = true;`, and every bool
#   local in the estate would otherwise be a finding -- noise that would bury the rule.
# * money makes them OPTIONAL, because locals and parameters are exactly where the bug lives:
#   `double total = 0;` accumulating invoice lines is the textbook case, and it carries no
#   modifier. The `is_money_name` filter is what makes that safe -- it is the name, not the
#   modifier, doing the discriminating.
#
# Neither matches a method: a `(` after the name is not in either tail set.
