"""Where a pin stands within its release line, and against the newest line. Pure.

Decision 14 of the 2026-10-02 plan separates two questions the gate used to ask as one:

* Is there a newer release IN THE PINNED LINE? A patch -- security and bug fixes -- and the
  gate blocks until it is taken or deferred (decisions 2 and 3).
* Is there a newer LINE? A major. A notice while the pinned line has more than a year of
  support left; mandatory with a year or less; blocking outright past its end of support.

THE LINE is the lifecycle cycle where endoflife.date publishes one (standards_deps_lifecycle),
else the semantic major -- or `0.minor` below 1.0, where every minor is a breaking release.

WITHOUT A LIFECYCLE, support is read off the vendor's behaviour (Jack, 2026-10-02): a newer
major is a notice while the pinned line still ships; once it has had no release for a year while
a newer line exists, the vendor has stopped supporting it in every way that matters, and the
upgrade is mandatory. Without that, "notice" could quietly become "never".
