"""Who the deploy logs in as, what it trusts, and who the container runs as.

Split from standards_compose.py rather than added to it. That module was at 468 of the
pack's own 500 lines, and the subject is genuinely different: the compose rules are about
how a stack is DEFINED -- ports, names, which overlay production loads -- while these are
about the identity the pipeline assumes when it reaches the machine, and the identity the
process keeps once it is there.

Every rule here comes from the 2026-08-18 deployment audit of the Allegro IT estate, where
all ten deploy workflows in nine repos shared the same three properties:

  deploy-root-ssh       every workflow logged into production as `root`. A CI key with a
                        root shell means any compromise of the workflow, the key secret, or
                        the third-party SSH action is a full host takeover -- and the action
                        is the part nobody here controls.
  deploy-no-hostkey     none of them set `fingerprint:`, so each trusted whatever answered
                        at the address. Anything able to answer for the host -- a hijacked
                        DNS record, a BGP detour -- collected a credential with write access
                        to every stack on the box.
  container-root-user   the app containers ran as root because `USER` was never set. The
                        .NET and Node runtime images all ship a ready non-root user for
                        exactly this, so the fix is one line and the omission is pure
                        inheritance from the base image.

  compose-read-only     added 2026-08-21, the sibling of the rule above and the last cheap
                        item in the set. Non-root says what the process may DO; read-only
                        says what it may LEAVE BEHIND. It was unavailable in InvoTrack until
                        that day only because the app wrote generated PDFs into its own
                        image; once that write was removed, nothing outside the volumes was
                        written and the setting became free.

  deploy-no-pull        added 2026-09-28. Not one of the ten deploy scripts ever pulled, so
                        the server kept the first copy of every tag it had downloaded:
                        `mysql:8.4` was seven months old and `nginx:1.27-alpine` seventeen,
                        while the tags upstream had moved on with their security patches.
                        Since 2026-10-02 tags are pinned exactly and moved by the dependency
                        gate; the pull is still what fetches a newly pinned tag onto the box,
                        and what picks up an official image rebuilt under the same tag.

None of the first three had ever failed, which is the point: they are not bug reports, they
are the properties that decide how bad an unrelated bug is allowed to get.

The prose half -- the migration recipe, and the honest framing of what a docker-group
deploy user does and does not buy -- is claude/rules/publishing.md.

    The sibling of container-root-user, and the last cheap item in the container-hardening
    set. Non-root says what the process may do; read-only says what it may leave behind. With
    both, code execution inside the container cannot drop a webshell, patch the app's own
    assemblies, or persist anything across a recreate -- a foothold becomes something that
    vanishes on restart.

    THE TRIGGER IS `build:`, not the service name or the proxy network, and that is what makes
    the rule quiet enough to keep. A service with `build:` has its Dockerfile here: we control
    what it writes and can give any new path a volume. A service running a third-party image
    (mysql, redis, mailhog) is one whose write behaviour we do not control, and where
    read-only routinely stops the container starting at all -- the official MySQL entrypoint
    writes to its datadir, /var/run and /tmp before it will serve. Flagging those would produce
    findings whose only correct resolution is an exemption, and a rule whose findings are all
    exemptions is noise that gets switched off.

    Base file only: hardening belongs there so development exercises the same constraints.

    WHAT IT COSTS, stated because this rule asks for real work rather than a one-line addition.
    Every path the app writes must become a volume or a tmpfs, and a missed one fails LATE --
    the container starts, serves, logs a user in, and dies only when somebody exercises that
    one feature. Grep CreateDirectory / WriteAllBytes / FileStream / open(...,'w') / fopen
    before switching it on, and check where the logger writes: stdout needs nothing, a file
    sink needs a home.

    TWO TRAPS MEASURED ON INVOTRACK 2026-08-21, both of which look like success:

    * A tmpfs is mounted ROOT-OWNED AT 0755 unless the path is /tmp, which Docker special-cases
      to 1777. So `- /home/app:size=16m` mounts fine, shows up in `docker inspect`, and is
      still unwritable by the app's uid. Pass `uid=`/`gid=` explicitly.
    * The runtime's HOME may be load-bearing without anything saying so. InvoTrack's publish
      notes recorded that QuestPDF/Skia "needed no XDG_CACHE_HOME workaround: /home/app is
      writable" -- a sentence that reads as trivia until read_only removes the writability, at
      which point PDF generation is the only thing that breaks.
