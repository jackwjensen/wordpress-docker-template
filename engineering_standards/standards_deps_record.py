"""The repository's record of version decisions: `.standards-dependencies.json`.

WHAT IT HOLDS, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT. Decisions, each about ONE release of ONE
dependency: `updated` (moved to it), `deferred` (not yet -- with a reason and an expiry), or
`rejected` (not this one -- with a reason). It never holds the pinned version, which lives in
the manifest that declares it (a second copy would be a second place to disagree), and it never
holds a "last checked" timestamp: freshness is proven by the gate checking live at push, and a
timestamp in a committed file would be stale by the next push (plan 2026-10-02, decision 7).
So the file changes only when somebody decided something, and reads as the history of why the
repository is on the versions it is on.

THE ESCAPE HATCH HAS LIMITS IN CODE, not only in prose (decision 3): a deferral needs a reason
of at least MIN_EXEMPTION_REASON_LENGTH characters and an expiry no more than MAX_DEFERRAL_DAYS
away, and an expired deferral covers nothing. Who may write one is judgment the code cannot
make -- Claude never writes a deferral, it proposes one -- so every active deferral is printed
on every run, where it cannot be forgotten.
