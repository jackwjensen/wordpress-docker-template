"""Cases for the repository-shape rules: generic-filename and the gitignore family.

Two things here are pinned harder than the rest, because both are places the rule was
already wrong once or would silently become useless:

* THE DIRECTORY ASYMMETRY. A junk drawer fires under a meaningful directory; a bare role
  noun does not. The first draft treated them alike and reported 8 findings that were the
  Django app layout doing exactly what it is supposed to. If someone later "simplifies"
  those two families into one test, these cases are the reason not to.
* THE GITIGNORE SPELLINGS. `bin/`, `/bin`, `**/bin` and `[Bb]in/` are one pattern written
  four ways, and Visual Studio's own template writes the fourth. A literal comparison
  passes its unit tests and then reports every .NET repo in the estate as unignored.
