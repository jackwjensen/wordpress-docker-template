"""Markdown and tree primitives shared by the documentation-dimension modules.

standards_docs (structure), standards_symbols (stale symbols), standards_coverage
(uncovered elements) and standards_userdocs (the shipped user-docs contract) all read the
same docs tree the same way. These are the primitives they share -- split out when
standards_docs crossed the file-length limit, because "how markdown is read" is a
different reason to change than any one rule family. A leaf module: imports nothing from
its consumers, so no import cycle can form.
