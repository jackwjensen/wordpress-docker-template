"""Documentation coverage: elements that ship with no documentation at all.

Every other documentation rule audits the docs that exist -- structure, links, staleness.
These audit the gap the other direction: an element a reader will meet that no
documentation names. "Feature" is undecidable mechanically, so the rules cover the
enumerable proxies, and the judgment half ("did this change ship with its docs?") stays
with /code-review and the doc-before-commit workflow:

    docs-uncovered-command  a Django management command no documentation names
    docs-uncovered-env      an .env.example key with no comment and no mention anywhere
    docs-uncovered-route    a declared public route no documentation names

"Named" means the token appears anywhere in the documentation corpus: every docs/ page,
README.md and CLAUDE.md. Substring match, deliberately -- command stems and env keys are
long and distinctive, and demanding a backtick span would fail prose that is perfectly
good documentation.

REPO-LEVEL, LIKE standards_docs. Coverage is a property of the whole tree (the docs that
would cover a command can live anywhere in it), so `check_coverage` runs only on
whole-tree scans -- push and CI, never the commit stage -- and its findings ride the same
baseline ratchet: existing gaps are grandfathered on adoption, a NEW command/key/route
must arrive documented, which is the doc-before-commit rule made mechanical for the
subset a scanner can see.

ROUTES NEED A REPO-DECLARED INVENTORY. There is no universal place routes live, so a repo
that wants route coverage declares where its enumeration is in .standards.json:

    "docsRouteInventories": [
      { "file": "scripts/generate-sitemap.mjs", "pattern": "path:\\s*'([^']+)'" }
    ]

The pattern's first capture group is the route token. No config, no route checking --
the other two surfaces need no config at all.

EXEMPTIONS. A command exempts itself file-scoped (`standards: docs-uncovered-command
exempt -- <why>` in its header) -- one file is one command, so the file scope is the
natural one. A route exempts line-scoped, on a comment line above its inventory entry. An
env key needs no marker: a `#` comment beside it IS the documentation, which is the whole
point of the rule.
