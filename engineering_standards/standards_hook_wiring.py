"""Is the commit gate actually wired in this clone? Asked at push, reported never enforced.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The git hooks are the layer that makes the gates fire for every client --
terminal, IDE button, GUI, coding agent -- and they are wired per CLONE, with one command
that nothing repeats and nothing verifies:

    git config core.hooksPath engineering_standards/hooks

A clone where that was never run has no gate. Not a failing gate: no gate. Every commit
passes, the developer sees exactly what a compliant developer sees, and the first anyone
hears of it is CI rejecting a branch's worth of work -- or not, if CI is informational.

THE CASE THAT PROVED IT, in the B3D pack on 2026-09-04: the repo that SHIPS the fail-closed
doctrine had `core.hooksPath` pointing at a directory that did not exist there, so the setting
looked right, `git config` echoed it back, and git silently ran nothing on every commit for
the life of a branch. Found by eye while committing, not by any check -- which is the whole
argument for this module. Copied here 2026-09-05; this pack's own hooks are wired, and the
test that says so is what keeps that from being a claim.

WHY A WARNING AND NOT A VIOLATION, decided rather than defaulted. A Violation fails the gate,
and this is a property of somebody's WORKING COPY, not of the repository's content:

  * CI has no hooks and never should -- it runs verify directly. A Violation would fail every
    CI run in every adopted repo, and the rule would be deleted the same week.
  * A contractor or a reviewer with a fresh clone must be able to commit and push. Refusing
    would make the pack's first act in a new clone a refusal.

So it prints, on stderr, and changes no exit code. It is the same instrument
`standards_pack_update` uses for "your copy is behind" and `warn_unreadable` uses for "I
could not look": the scanner reporting a limit on its own reach rather than a finding about
the code.

WHY PUSH AND NOT COMMIT. At commit stage this would be self-defeating -- if the hooks are not
wired, no commit-stage check runs at all, so the one moment it could speak is the moment it
cannot. Push is where verify is also invoked directly by CI and by a human, so the message
reaches somebody either way.
