"""docs-stale-symbol: whether a backtick-quoted name is one this repository has.

Its own module because the resolver is its own module, and because the interesting cases
are not "is the name spelled right" but "which tree are we asking". The rule consults git
rather than the filesystem, so a developer with a built, installed tree gets the same
answer as CI's clean checkout — a split there is worse than a strict rule, because the
local run is the one people trust and the deploy is where they find out.
