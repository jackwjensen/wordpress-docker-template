"""`.standards.json` may relax a rule. It may not do so silently.

THE HOLE THIS CLOSES. Every other relaxation in this pack states its case where somebody
meets it: an exemption sits in the file and is printed every run, a baseline is a reviewed
ledger, and `NEVER_BASELINED` refuses the findings for which deferral is not even coherent.
`.standards.json` could do none of that. One line disabled any rule, required no argument,
and appeared in no output -- so a repo with `{"checkGitignore": false}` printed exactly the
`clean` that an honest repo printed. Bolting every front door while leaving that open is
worth very little.

Two halves, and both are load-bearing:
  * a weakening must carry a reason, at the exemption floor;
  * a weakening must be NAMED in the summary, or requiring the reason only moves the
    silence somewhere quieter.

A tightening is free. Charging a repo an argument for `maxFileLines: 300` would teach
people that the config is hostile, and the next thing they learn is `--no-verify`.
