"""How long a dependency's release line is supported, from endoflife.date.

Decision 14 of the 2026-10-02 plan (Jack): *"A major upgrade is only mandatory if the support of
current major version is less than one year. If the support is longer ... it is just a
notification that the new major version exists."* Which date counts is endoflife.date's published
end of support (Jack, same day) -- the one source the gate reads, rather than a date per vendor.

A LINE is endoflife.date's *cycle*: MySQL `8.4`, .NET `10`, Node `24`, Python `3.14`. A version
belongs to the cycle whose numbers prefix its own (`8.4.11` -> `8.4`, `10.0.401` -> `10`). Only
products the estate actually runs are mapped -- the runtimes, databases and base images, where a
line move is expensive. An unmapped dependency has no lifecycle, and the verdict falls back to
the package rule (standards_deps_lines).

EF Core has no endoflife.date entry of its own and is mapped to .NET: an EF Core major tracks
the .NET major, the same assumption the pack's EF_CORE_FLOOR = DOTNET_FLOOR already makes.
