"""The dependency gate's judgement of one declared dependency. Pure.

A declaration, a registry answer, its lifecycle, the record and a date in; a verdict out. No
network, no filesystem -- which is what lets every state below be pinned by a test.

| State | Why | Blocks? |
|---|---|---|
| CURRENT         | the newest release in its line, and no later line worth naming | no |
| MAJOR_AVAILABLE | a later line exists; the pinned one has over a year of support | no -- a notice |
| COVERED         | the blocking release is named by an active deferral or rejection | no, printed |
| NEWER           | a newer release IN THE PINNED LINE nobody has looked at (a patch) | YES |
| MAJOR_DUE       | a later line exists; the pinned one has a year or less of support | YES |
| UNSUPPORTED     | the pinned line is past its end of support | YES |
| EXPIRED         | the deferral that covered the blocking release has run out | YES |
| UNPINNED        | a range, a floating tag, a branch -- a version nobody chose | YES |
| UNREACHABLE     | the registry or the lifecycle source did not answer | locally no; in CI yes |

Decision 14 of the 2026-10-02 plan is the split between NEWER and the major states: a patch is
security and bug fixes and always blocks; a new major is only mandatory once the pinned line's
support runs under a year (standards_deps_lines).

An `updated` record for a release the manifest does not pin is still blocking: the record cannot
claim a move the code never made.
