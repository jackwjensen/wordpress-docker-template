"""Values that are likely to change, and the three places one can live.

Added 2026-09-07 after a constants audit on `payvisia` found 191 `const` declarations where
its author normally carries fewer than ten. Jack's statement of the rule:

    Anything that may change should not be a constant. We may not need a UI to change them
    if it is unlikely but possible they will change. In that case it is ok we can change the
    value in a db table or config file.

The second sentence is the important half: the standard is NOT "build an admin screen for every
value", it is "put the value where changing it costs what the change is worth". The prose half
is `claude/rules/configuration.md`; the reasoning, the measurements, the four false-positive
classes these detectors had to lose, and what was deliberately NOT implemented are in
`docs/values-that-change.md`. None of that is restated here -- a rule in two layers drifts.

Three shapes. The first two are per-file; the third is repo-level and runs from
`standards_repository.py`, because no per-file rule can see the other file:

  * `config-default-in-code` -- a configuration read whose fallback is a literal. The value
    already IS configuration and there is a second copy of it in the source, which is the
    committed-credential shape from `secrets.md` generalised past credentials.
  * `const-environment-literal` -- a constant whose VALUE is environment-specific by its own
    shape: an e-mail address, an absolute filesystem path, a URL or a host:port.
  * `const-duplicated-literal` -- one value with two homes, or a constant written raw in
    another file. It reads the tree twice, and it honours its own line exemptions rather than
    relying on the driver's filter, which only ever sees the per-file walk's findings.

KNOWN BLIND SPOT, stated here because it is load-bearing for the first rule.
`config-default-in-code` reads one line at a time, so a fallback reached through a HELPER is
invisible to it -- neither line of `Stated(app.Configuration, KEY) ?? (isDev ? Fallback : null)`
carries both an accessor and a literal. `const-environment-literal` catches that case from the
declaration side instead; where the value's shape gives nothing away it is judgment.
