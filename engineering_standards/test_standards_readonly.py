"""Cases for the compose-read-only rule.

The negatives decide whether this rule is keepable. It reads every compose file in the
estate, and the services it must stay silent on -- mysql, redis, mailhog -- are exactly the
ones where read_only commonly prevents the container starting at all. If it fired on those,
every finding's only correct resolution would be an exemption, and a rule whose findings are
all exemptions is noise that gets switched off.
