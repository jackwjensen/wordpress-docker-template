"""Background jobs that cannot report their own failure.

A JOB THAT CANNOT FAIL IS THE SAME DEFECT AS A GATE THAT CANNOT FAIL, and this pack has
been bitten by that shape repeatedly: a skipped gate indistinguishable from a passing one,
a probe that printed nothing where "no interpreter" and "no findings" looked identical,
`test-always-passes`. The instrument is always the same -- make the silent success
impossible to mistake for a real one -- and it had never been pointed at workers.

FOUND IN allegro-it-services' CELERY WORKER, 2026-09-02, and the admin table is the whole
specification: a hundred rows of task history in which TASK NAME, PERIODIC TASK NAME and
WORKER were all `-`, and TASK STATE was SUCCESS in every single row. Nobody could say what
had run, where, or whether it had worked. Three separate defects produce that one table,
and they need three separate rules, because fixing any one of them leaves the other two:

* `job-results-anonymous`  -- the history is stored WITHOUT the task's name.
* `job-swallows-failure`   -- the task catches everything and returns normally, so the row
                              says SUCCESS whatever happened.
* `job-results-not-stored` -- there is no result backend, so an outcome is nowhere at all.

WHY THE NAME IS MISSING IS A ONE-LINE SETTING, which is what makes it worth a rule rather
than a rules-file paragraph. Celery's `result_extended` defaults to False, and with it off
django-celery-results records only the id, the state and the timestamp -- the name, the
arguments and the worker are left NULL, which is exactly the `-` in every column. It is not
recoverable afterwards: the rows already written stay anonymous.
