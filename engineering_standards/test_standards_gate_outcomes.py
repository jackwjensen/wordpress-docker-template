"""Skip classification -- the half of the gate where a wrong answer is invisible.

A skip is invisible in the exit code, so a pattern that matches too eagerly turns a real
failure into a pass -- the exact shape of bug this pack exists to prevent. Every case here is
one of two kinds: a phrase that MUST read as "the tool is not here", and a phrase that looks
similar and MUST NOT. The second kind is the negative control, and it is the one that matters.

Moved out of `test_standards_gate.py` on 2026-09-05 with the code it tests; the stage
assignment cases stay there.
