"""docs-stale-symbol: backtick-quoted names in docs/ that the codebase no longer contains.

The docs version of the code review's "confirm every helper the diff references actually
exists": a renamed helper leaves its old name behind in prose, and the prose goes on
teaching the wrong name. Split out of standards_docs when that module crossed the
file-length limit -- symbol resolution (the repository inventory, the monorepo package
fallback, the path-versus-identifier split) is its own subject with its own change
history, while the structural rules over there share nothing with it but the primitives
in standards_markdown.
