"""Things a repository should never ship: a live config-disclosure page, and a schema dump.

Rules here: disclosure-file, committed-sql-dump.

WHY THE TWO SHARE A MODULE. Neither is about how the code is WRITTEN -- both are about
something ENTERING the tree that has no business being version-controlled at all. A
`phpinfo.php` is a diagnostic that turned into a public endpoint; a `revjus.sql` is a
one-off export that turned into the repository's idea of a schema. They change for the same
reason (someone committed a convenience and it stayed), and neither has an opinion about a
line of application logic, which is what keeps them out of the per-language dispatcher's
subject and here instead.

    disclosure-file     a phpinfo() page, or a sensitive file by name -- a config, an
                        installer, a committed database, a certificate, a credential store
    committed-sql-dump   a *.sql schema dump checked in instead of migrations

WHY disclosure-file IS A LIST, NOT ONE FILE. phpinfo is the classic case, but the family is
"a file whose mere presence in the tree is the leak", and it spans the estate's frameworks:
WordPress `wp-config.php` (DB credentials + auth salts) and its `wp-admin/` installer; a
committed SQLite database (Django's `db.sqlite3`, Laravel's `database.sqlite`, or any
`*.sqlite`), whose rows ship with the repo; a .NET/Blazor `*.pubxml.user` (the deploy
password) or a `*.pfx`/`*.p12` (a certificate WITH its private key); an Adminer drop-in
database console; and the credential stores `.htpasswd`, `.pypirc`, `.git-credentials`,
`.netrc`. None is caught by the credential-FORMAT scanner, because a DB password or a binary
key store has no recognisable shape -- it is the NAME that identifies them.

WHY disclosure-file EARNS A RULE. A real audit found a repo shipping `phpinfo.php` whose
entire body was `<?php phpinfo(); ?>`. `phpinfo()` renders the COMPLETE PHP and server
configuration -- absolute paths, PHP and extension versions, every loaded module, the full
environment including anything the process inherited -- as a single HTML page. Anyone who
can reach the URL reads it, unauthenticated, and it is the reconnaissance step that turns a
vague "there is a PHP app here" into "here is its exact stack and where its files live". The
fix is not to guard it; it is to delete it. A deliberate local diagnostic is a local file,
and a local file does not get committed.

WHY committed-sql-dump EARNS A RULE. The same audit found `revjus.sql` (1.4 MB) and
`RevjusStaging_15102025.sql` (3.6 MB) -- hand-exported schema dumps checked in beside the
code, standing in for migrations. Two defects in one artefact. First, reproducibility: a
dump is a FROZEN SNAPSHOT, not a history. It records what the schema was on the day someone
clicked export, with no record of how it got there and no way to apply it forward
incrementally; the next person diverges from it silently and nothing reconciles the two.
Second, exposure: a dump that carries rows carries whatever was in those rows, and a
staging export is exactly where real personal data rides along unnoticed. Migrations are
the mechanism that fixes both -- versioned, reviewable, applyable -- which is why a `.sql`
UNDER a migrations directory is the opposite finding and is never flagged.

THE THIRD KIND OF .sql FILE, and why the rule needed a marker. A dump is the OUTPUT of an
exporter. A migration is a STEP. But a schema can also be the INPUT to a compiler -- a file
whose whole job is to create an empty database from nothing, every build, as part of
producing an artifact. sourcetext.ai's `pipeline/schema.sql` is one: `pipeline/spec.py`
reads it to build a read-only corpus database that is then filled from ingested sources and
shipped inside an image. Neither of the two defects above can occur -- there is no snapshot
to diverge from, because the file IS the definition and the database is rebuilt rather than
migrated, and no rows can ride along, because it declares tables and inserts nothing.

That file was flagged on 2026-09-01 with no honest way to answer. Its three location
opt-outs all describe something it is not, and this was the ONLY rule in the pack with no
in-file marker -- a gap this module's own docstring used to assert as a design choice. It
was not one: it made the rule unfalsifiable, and a rule that cannot be answered is a rule
that gets worked around. So `committed-sql-dump` now takes the same marker every other
smoke-alarm rule takes, with the same reason floor:

    -- standards: committed-sql-dump exempt -- <why this is not a dump>

The reason is the gate, exactly as it is for file-length. "It is fine" is rejected on
length; an argument you would defend in review is not.

    INPUT rather than an exporter's output (see the module docstring). Location is tested
    first because it costs a string search against a path already in hand; the marker costs
    a file read.

    Both are tested BEFORE `_sql_is_schema_dump`, which is the expensive step -- it may
