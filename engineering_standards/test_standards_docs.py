"""The documentation dimension's mechanical rules: structure, frontmatter, links, orphans.

Each case builds a throwaway repo tree and runs `check_documentation` over it directly --
the repo-level entry point that check-source-limits.py calls on whole-tree scans. The CLI
integration (baseline ratchet, gate refusal) is covered by test_hook_blocks.py; these cases
own the rules themselves.

Run: python test_standards_docs.py   (or pytest)
