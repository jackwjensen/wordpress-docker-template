"""`pack-no-debt`: the supplier carries none of the debt it lets its consumers carry.

A CONSUMING repo is allowed a baseline. That is the whole point of the ratchet -- the pack
has to be able to land in a repo with a wall of existing violations without a wall of red,
or it never lands at all. `refactoring.md` then says pay it down as work touches the repo.

THE PACK IS NOT ONE OF THOSE REPOS. Every rule in the estate is authored in these ~100
modules, and a rule its own author does not run is a rule nobody has tested against real
code. The pack shipped exactly that until 2026-09-02: `python/ruff-standards.toml` went to
nine repositories while this repo's pyproject.toml carried a comment declining to adopt it --
"a separate decision with its own findings to work through". That is the definition of debt,
written down and left. Adopting it surfaced 134 findings, one of which (`B021`) was three
docstrings Python had been discarding at runtime for months.

So the asymmetry is deliberate and it runs one way only: consumers get the ratchet, the
supplier does not. This rule fires ONLY in the pack -- `is_the_pack_itself` -- because in a
consuming repo every one of these files is legitimate.

WHAT THIS RULE DOES NOT DO is re-check ruff's findings. Declaring ruff in pyproject.toml is
what makes `standards_gates.python_gates` build a ruff gate, so the findings already block a
push on their own. Checking them twice would be the two-layer drift this pack forbids. What
cannot enforce itself is the DECLARATION -- deleting the `[tool.ruff]` block removes the gate
and turns the push green, which is the one edit that must never look like an improvement.
