"""Credentials must not reach git. The enforceable half of claude/rules/secrets.md.

Rules here: committed-credential.

WHY THIS RUNS AT THE COMMIT STAGE, against the pack's usual staging. Nearly every repo-level
rule here runs at PUSH, because a commit-stage finding can block the very commit that fixes it.
Credentials invert that: **the commit IS the boundary.** Once a working credential is in a
commit, the fix stops being an edit and becomes a history rewrite plus a rotation. Blocking at
push is already too late. So this runs on the STAGED set at commit, and the whole tree at push
to catch what was already tracked before the pack landed.

WHY THE USUAL BIAS INVERTS TOO, AND WHERE IT DOES NOT. The pack's rules deliberately err toward
silence, because a noisy rule gets exempted wholesale and an exempted rule is not running. Here
a false negative costs a rotation and a history rewrite while a false positive costs one
exemption line -- so the cost asymmetry points the other way. But wholesale exemption is still
the failure that kills a rule, so the answer is not "be aggressive", it is TWO TIERS with
different powers:

  FORMAT   a known credential shape -- `sk_live_`, `AKIA…`, a PEM private key. These are never
           placeholders, so they block and cannot be baselined.
  SHAPE    a secret-NAMED key holding a value that is not obviously a placeholder. Blocks, but
           is line-exemptable, because only a human can say "that is our fake demo value".

THE VALUE IS NEVER PRINTED. Findings name the key and the format, never the secret. Most secret
scanners echo the match into CI logs, which relocates the leak rather than closing it -- and the
estate's own standing rule is to never echo a leaked value anywhere.

`.env` IS DETECTED BY NAME AND NEVER OPENED. A staged `.env` is itself the finding; no read is
required to know that, and reading it would break the same standing rule. THE RULE RETURNING
EARLY IS NOT WHAT MAKES THAT TRUE -- the scanner's reader opens every candidate file before any
rule is dispatched, so the invariant held in this module and was false in the pipeline feeding
it until 2026-09-05. `is_never_read` below is the enforcement point; the reader and the rule
both ask it, so the set of files never opened and the set reported by name are one set.

THE PATTERNS DO NOT MATCH THIS FILE, by construction: every format requires a payload after its
prefix, so the bare prefix written here as a regex matches nothing. That is deliberate -- a
detector that fires on its own source teaches people to exempt it on sight.

    THE CLAIM THIS MAKES TRUE. This module's header has always said a `.env` is detected by

    That was not the whole story: the reader in standards_exemption_report -- the one the
    driver imports -- read every candidate file into memory before dispatching to any rule,
    so a `.env` in scope was opened, decoded and held, by the scanner belonging to an estate

    so the leak was of custody rather than of output. It was still the documented invariant
    being false in the one file it exists for. Found in the B3D pack, copied here 2026-09-05.

    Exported from here rather than added to standards_scope, because scope answers "is this
    file checked?" -- and a `.env` IS checked, by name. This answers a different question:
    what the reader is allowed to do to get there. One predicate, so the reader and
