"""Which exemption markers actually do something, and a rule that reports the ones that do not.

`standards_exemptions.py` owns the marker SYNTAX -- one parser, one reason floor, two scopes.
This module owns the other half of the contract: which tag a rule will actually read, and at
which scope. Nothing enforced that before, and the gap ran the wrong way.

THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES IS THE INVERSE OF THE ONE `collect_exemptions` WAS WRITTEN TO CLOSE.
That report exists because a marker could silence a rule invisibly, so it names every
relaxation the scanner honours. But `header_exemptions` reads whatever tag it FINDS -- which
is right, and is what stopped a hand-kept list of three rules from hiding the other
seventeen -- and nothing then checked that any rule would read that tag back. So a run could
print

    exempt: engine/config.py [const-environment-literal] -- <a reason somebody wrote>

and report the finding two lines later, because `check_environment_literal` consulted no
exemption helper at all. Found on sourcetext.ai, 2026-09-09, on three files. A report that
claims a decision the scanner ignores is worse than no report: the claim is the thing people
rely on, and this one was reassuring in exactly the runs where it was wrong.

WHY A VIOLATION RATHER THAN A QUIETER REPORT. The alternatives were to label such markers
inert in the summary, or to drop them from it. Both leave the marker sitting in the file and
its author still believing it works -- which is the whole failure. Jack's call, 2026-09-09:
a marker that does nothing is a defect in the file, so somebody deletes it or fixes the tag.
It catches a misspelled tag too, which no other detector in the pack could see at all.

TWO INPUTS DECIDE, AND NEITHER IS A SECOND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FIRST. The registry below
says which tags are real at which scope; the READERS themselves say whether a marker in this
position would be found. Asking `exemption_reason` and `line_exemption_reason` rather than
re-deriving where a marker carries is the point: a rule that disagreed with the readers about
what is honoured would be the very defect this module exists to end. It also settles the case
that looks like a contradiction -- a marker in a `#` block directly above the first code line
is inside the header AND within the line reader's lookbehind, so it is live at both scopes,
and neither answer alone is right.

THE TWO SETS ARE HAND-WRITTEN AND MACHINE-CHECKED. A hand-kept list of what the code does is
precisely the claim this pack refuses elsewhere, so `test_standards_exemption_scope.py`
derives both from the source and fails if either drifts. Adding a hatch to a rule means
adding its tag here, in the same commit, or the suite says so.
